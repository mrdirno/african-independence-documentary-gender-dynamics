## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character 'reads' a colonial documentary not for its narration, but for the unscripted truths in the background—a worker's expression, the state of a child's clothes, the gender of those performing labor.
- Create a monologue from the perspective of a market woman explaining her 'mathematics'—the real cost of the new borehole, school fees, or a bag of rice—to a male journalist or official.
- Draft a 'counter-documentary' script for a short film Ama and Samuel might make, using only found footage and voiceover from interviews with women.
- Write a letter from Ama to a former student, now a young woman, explaining why learning to write her own name was, as Samuel said, 'a revolutionary act.'

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a simple web app that presents two parallel narratives side-by-side: the official transcript of a colonial documentary and a 'crowdsourced' annotation layer where users can add the real stories, costs, and perspectives hidden in each frame.
- Create a data visualization project that maps the 'unrecorded economy' of women's labor (water fetching, food processing, child care, small-scale trade) against the 'official' infrastructure projects highlighted in colonial propaganda.
