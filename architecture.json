Book cover framing, centered composition with a shallow depth of field, shot from a low, intimate angle that elevates the subject. Cinematic chiaroscuro lighting with a palette of deep amber, rich sepia, burnt umber, and muted olive green, punctuated by the cold blue-white flicker of the propaganda film. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
